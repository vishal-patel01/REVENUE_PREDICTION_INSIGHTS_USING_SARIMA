This repository hosts a comprehensive navigation menu for hotel revenue analytics and predictions. The interface consists of three key sections:

1. **Dashboard**: The central hub furnishing insightful revenue analytics for hotels. It provides a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators such as Total Revenue, Revenue by Room type, Daytype wise Revenue, Property wise Revenue, Occupancy, and ADR. Users can customize data display using filters for Hotel, City, Room Class, Start Date, and End Date. Real-time updates are facilitated through CSV file uploads, enabling dynamic analysis and data-driven decision-making.

2. **Category-wise Prediction**: Empowers users with category-specific forecasts, allowing input parameters like room category, property name, Category, City, and Room Class. By offering precise predictions tailored to different segments, stakeholders can anticipate revenue outcomes with greater accuracy and make informed decisions for each category within the hotel's offerings.

3. **Forecast Prediction**: Utilizes an SARIMA model to forecast revenue for the next 30 days. Graphical representations illustrate forecasted revenue trends, aiding users in visualizing future revenue patterns. A downloadable dataset is provided for further analysis or integration into planning processes.

This interface provides a holistic view of revenue performance, tailored predictions, and actionable insights, facilitating informed decision-making for optimizing revenue generation in the hotel industry.
